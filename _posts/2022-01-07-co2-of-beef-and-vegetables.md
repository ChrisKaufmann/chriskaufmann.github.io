For the record, I eat steaks. But this is BS.

I mean if you're growing your own tomatoes there's no reason you couldn't also grow your own peppers, cucumbers, spinach, and have a chickens. But that said: I wonder how bad the carbon foot print really is either way. I'd argue that 99% of people aren't eating locally sourced beef anyway, and the cows still need to be fed. Plus you should ague for grain-fed beef - grass is much worse than grain (they need more food and grow slower so they need even *more* food https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa6cd5/pdf )

Actually, it turns out we can directly compare them:
one beef based meal: 730lb co2 ( https://www.saveur.com/beef-climate-change-greenhouse-gas/ I'll throw in the tomatoes for free ) and we'll assume you walked over to the farmer and bought him a beer for it.

one avocado: 423lb co2 ( https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/revealed-the-enormous-carbon-footprint-linked-to-eating-avocado-a3591501.html )
one lb of almonds: 7.7lb co2 ( https://healabel.com/a-ingredients/almonds I'll use this one a lot)
one lb of chickpeas: 1.4lb co2 (above)
one dozen eggs (free range because yuppies): 4.8lb ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24570444/ )
two lb bell peppers: .5lb (above)
2lb cucumbers: .3lb
2lb spinach: .7lb

Transportation seems to account for a relatively small amount of the carbon footprint of most foods (  https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local ) which kind of makes sense if you're shipping tens of thousands of pounds of, say, tomatoes at a time.

Semi trucks have averaged over 5mpg for decades (and it makes my math easier. So I'm lazy. Sue me). 1 gallon of diesel is 22lbs of co2, and assume the truck is lightly loaded at 10,000 lbs (again lazy math).  Which means each lb of produce is .0022/mile of c02 equivalent. (ocean shipping is more efficient at something like 1/6-1/15 of the output of trucks so I'm using trucks here https://www.sourcinghub.io/air-freight-vs-sea-freight-carbon-footprint/ )

It's less than 3,000 miles from the farthest part of Mexico to Chicago so, for ease of my math, let's add 6.6 lbs of co2 to each of the imported items (which is a lie, because they're mostly grown in the US - chickpeas in Montana, the US grows 80% of the world's supply of almonds, etc, but hey. let's cheat and assume everything is shipped from there and it averages out)

one lb of steak: 730lb
10lbs of vegetables and a dozen eggs: 484lb including carbon from trucking
if you think avocados are gross (like me): 55lb including carbon from trucking

I have no idea how to do the horseradish sauce üôÅ but horseradish itself is grown in some place called "Southern Illinois" in the US.
