My hypothesis was that gas prices would track with either median income or population density, but not at all with the former, and barely with the latter. Nor does it track weird things like opoid use or miles driven per year or presidential vote. Essentially prices seem to go up the farther away you get from Tennessee. Or as I'll say: the deeper south you go, the cheaper gas is. /shrug

Anecdotally, prices were 100% inversely proportional to the dirty looks we got for wearing masks.

(Numbers rounded for prettiness, Chicago numbers are the Chicago metropolitan statistical area where available. I didn't think it was fair to compare the urban Chicago area to the mostly rural areas I was getting gas at)
