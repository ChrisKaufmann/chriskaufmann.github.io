And he hired his own family members, pardoned loyalists, profited from charging the government to protect him, golfed a record amount of times (at a cost to taxpayers of an estimated $144m https://www.trumpgolfcount.com ), put children in cages, had to get the presidential daily briefing dumbed down and still wouldn't read it, got impeached twice, fired the people who were leading investigations against him, fired anyone who wasn't "loyal enough", and oh yeah incited an insurrection against the capitol of the United States after he wouldn't admit he lost a fair and free election.
