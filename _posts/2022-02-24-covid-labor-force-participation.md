In case anyone is interested in what's going on here, the labor force participation rate plummeted from 63.4% in Feb 2020, to a low of 60.2% in April 2020, and has basically been recovering ever since. ( https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-labor-force-participation-rate.htm ) Because of that, there are fewer people for the jobs, which means labor has power for the first time in my lifetime. 

But: why is it still going? And where did these people go? If you look at the chart, the participation rate has been declining since roughly 2008 - basically the Boomers started to retire. The strong job market (a record of something like 100+ months of straight job growth during almost the entirety of the Obama presidency and most of the Trump presidency) arguably delayed many boomers from retiring. When there's low unemployment, why retire if you're making a decent living? (Down to 3.5%!!! https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm )

But does that explain right now? Mostly. 4.2 million people left the labor force between the start of the pandemic and Q2, 2021. Of those about 2.4 million were excess retirements. ( https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/economic-synopses/2021/10/15/the-covid-retirement-boom ) So a global pandemic during which old people are especially at risk, had been waiting for retirement, and (oh yeah) those empty nest houses were now much, much more valuable than they had been and may have let people sell and take off, so to speak. 

You may be asking yourself. What about the other 1.8 million people? It's primarily women who have had to drop out of the workforce ( https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/22/coronavirus-pandemic-women-workforce-500329 ) Which is actually continuing a trend that's been going on for two decades! ( https://usafacts.org/articles/its-not-just-the-pandemic-women-have-been-leaving-the-labor-force-for-more-than-20-years/ )  I don't have *good* statistics for the reason why, but it's well known that women are primary caregivers more often than men, and at the end of 2020, one in four child-care centers remained closed - where are kids gonna go? Home. Who's going to take care of them? Moms.
