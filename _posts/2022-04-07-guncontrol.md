Regarding: https://www.usconcealedcarry.com/resources/gun-facts-and-fiction/mass-shootings

There's some weird omissions and conflation here, and some spot on ones too.

Starting with "We should ban assault rifles and high-capacity magazines to stop mass shootings."
They state "some of the largest mass shootings in U.S. history were carried out with low-capacity weapons" and then immediately cite Virginia Tech - ignoring that it's "only" the 3rd deadliest, and the only one of the top 5 to not use what wikipedia calls "semi-automatic rifles" (which is exactly why they used it instead of the other four of the top five - and they're not unaware of them, see below).

Then, for the “The U.S. accounts for more than 30 percent of mass public shootings compared to other developed countries." section, it goes to try to cite a source. It brags about a 437 page data set. Which is a little awkward because the first 37 pages of its data are the literal warzone Afghanistan. The next 34 are the civil warzone Algeria. 24 are on Colombian FARC activity (another civil/guerilla war).  50 are on Iran and Iraq. 21 in Nigeria. 47 on Pakistan. 28 in the Philippines (another insurrection). You get the idea. The argument that we don't commit the vast majority of mass shootings is predicated on including warzones, insurrections, and violent third world countries (and conveniently stops in 2012).  Most lists go by first-world/developed countries which one would assume would be a better measurement and comparison. I mean I'd hope we have fewer large murder incidents than Afghanistan, you know?

They are, of course, exactly correct about "Mass killings are very rare, accounting for only 0.2 percent of homicides every year and approximately 1 percent of homicide victims."

Another example of shoddy data usage in the "More statistics to consider" section. They go to say the gun murder and suicide rates are down. 

Let's start with the gun murder rate. They brag that it went from 6.2 -> 4.6 (1976-2017) Which is great, a 34% drop. And they're using per 100k which is also exactly how it should be. But. The overall murder rate went from 8.8 -> 5.32  Which is better, a 40% drop. Which means the gun murder rate went down *less* than the overall murder rate. ( https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/htius.pdf  https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/murder-homicide-rate )  

Suicides: 7.7 -> 6.9. 11% drop. I'm not 100% sure where they get that rate or what it means, because firearm is by far the most, ... er,  "popular" method, and over 50% of them all. https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/suicide#part_2558 Best I can find is the rate is similar. https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/03/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/ although it dipped (like overall crime, interestingly) starting in the early 90's and then rose again. I suspect that it doesn't particularly matter because the rates mostly tend to be consistent by country but the numbers going down looks good for them.

"Mass shooters tend to choose so-called ‘gun-free zones’ for their attacks."​
is perfect. � (Here is exactly where they include locations not included in the above "assault rifles" section because now it's convenient. But they're technically correct which is of course the best kind of correct. In researching this diatribe, I learned that the whole "gun free zone" thing is only applicable at a federal level to schools. The rest are either state-by-state or just business-by-business. Starbucks being a classic example.)

OVERALL:
I'm not going to complain too much- federal research into gun violence has been basically prohibited because the NRA, via the Dickey Amendment, took away its funding! https://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-government-study-gun-violence/story?id=50300379 but that's finally changing ( https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/27/us/politics/gun-violence-research-cdc.html ) so we'll hopefully have some good data in the next few years. 

Meanwhile, new  research ( https://news.yahoo.com/california-adults-live-gun-owner-023321600.html ) says "Those who lived with a handgun owner were almost twice as likely to die by homicide as their neighbors without guns, the researchers found. More specifically, adults who lived with the owner of a handgun were almost three times more likely to be killed with a firearm than Californians in households where no handguns were present."  (Note that they used neighbors so you can't just say it's people in shitty neighborhoods or those who were more likely to get killed anyway) I personally interpret it in a similar manner to suicide barriers on bridges reducing the overall suicide rate. In the spur of the moment if there's basically any impediment, many will stop.
