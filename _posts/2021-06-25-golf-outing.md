I was invited down to the middle of nowhere. Well, not technically nowhere. Halfway between Not Quite Anywhere and A Suburb of Not Much really. Turns out where they have a lot of nothing, they sometimes put a golf course. They had a fundraiser for my grandmother's former nursing home. Former because that's where she passed. But we still get invited, and I go everywhere I'm invited.

I also have fond memories becuase while she was on her literal deathbed, I snuck her former cat in to say goodbye. He's purring for me, much the same way he purred one last time for her - for forty-five minutes.

Anyway, I was the middle of nowhere (almost). Early in the pandemic I started doing ridiculous things, like drawing pixellated video game characters on sidewalks of strangers or buying fencing swords or learning German. Now, my beloved cousin (all of my cousins are beloved. Only most of them are Horney...) was there, and I distracted her and snuck one of my swords into her bag when it was almost time to take off.

The nice thing about charity golf outings is they play what's called "best ball". All four of you hit, then you pick the "best ball" of the four and all hit from there, rinse, repeat. Which works great for me, because I don't exactly take things seriously. Like rules of games, or the security of nursing homes. For example: you're allowed a certain number of clubs in your bag. I used to carry more than that - in just six irons. I have woods made of wood, irons made of iron, and putters older than myself. I also have a plan. When the golfing part of the outing starts, everyone leaves for their hole at the same time. They call it a shotgun start, but it's an airhorn. Which is a shame because it's the one place you can fire a shotgun willy-nilly. I mean really. I also digress. But: shotgun start goes off and cousin has not yet noticed the sword.

Halfway to our hole (the 14th. I know the course a tiny bit because I played it quite a bit without paying a couple of decades ago) I pull alongside her, and reach behind my back like I was reaching for a sword. Which I was. I get her attention, say "defend yourself", and start a swordfight down the 14th fairway.
