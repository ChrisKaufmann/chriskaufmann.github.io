* Start production time: 
  * 100 minute print, manual removal and start.
  * 80 minute print, 20 minute cooldown.
* End production time: 
  * 28 minutes each, automatically ejecting and restarting to do continuous production.
  * 22 minute print time, 6 minutes to cool down the bed to where it could be ejected.
  * Custom solution cooled printing surface down with three fans to speed up production.
* Least likely product necessary to improve speed
  * Cheap hairspray.
* Least likely product necessary to do continuous production
  * Empty Diet Coke case to catch ejected parts.
* Printer noise (as measured by free iphone app aligned with lower-left-hand of mouse pad three feet from printer):
  * Before any modifications: 54dba
  * After modifications: 37dba
  * Number of fans replaced: 4
  * Best improvement in sound reduction: new motherboard, $39, 8dba reduction.
  * Least effective improvement in sound reduction: part cooling fan, $15, 0dba reduction but changed the pitch of audible noise.
* Best improvement in print speed:
  * Increasing nozzle size from 0.4mm to 1.0mm  (with corresponding layer heights) (1h11m -> 25m).
* Main group (of which I was in the first 10 members) distributed 23,000 shields.
